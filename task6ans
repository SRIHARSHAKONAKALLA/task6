In this program, we first import the necessary libraries for machine learning in Python. We then load the dataset into a pandas dataframe and split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function. We use the LinearRegression algorithm to train the model on the training set and predict on the testing set using the predict function.

Finally, we evaluate the model by calculating the mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) using the mean_squared_error function from scikit-learn. This gives us a measure of how well the model is able to predict the house prices based on their square footage.
